## Testing Strategy: Fuzzybots

### Overview

Fuzzybots is a continuous multi-node simulation framework designed to test blockchain network behavior under realistic conditions. Rather than traditional unit tests that verify isolated components, fuzzybots creates a living network that exercises the entire system.

### Architecture

The fuzzybot framework (`testing/bot.go`) creates a network of 7 autonomous nodes:
- 1 seed node (acts as initial peer for discovery)
- 6 client nodes (connect to seed and each other through peer discovery)

Each bot operates independently with:
- **Randomized mining intervals**: 10-120 seconds between mining attempts
- **Realistic transaction generation**: Bots create transactions when they have sufficient balance
- **Proper nonce management**: Sequential transaction nonces within blocks
- **Chain state monitoring**: Periodic logging of chain height and head hash

### Key Features

**Emergent Behavior Testing**: Rather than scripted scenarios, the system generates organic network conditions through random timing, allowing discovery of race conditions and edge cases that structured tests might miss.

**Real P2P Communication**: Uses the actual networking stack with TCP connections, message serialization, and peer discovery protocols.

**Continuous Validation**: Runs indefinitely, validating that the blockchain maintains consistency across all nodes despite concurrent mining and network delays.

**Observable State**: Periodic chain status logging allows monitoring of network convergence and identifying synchronization issues.

### Design Rationale

Traditional blockchain testing often uses mocked networks or deterministic scenarios. Fuzzybots takes a different approach by creating controlled chaos that mirrors real-world conditions where nodes have varying processing speeds, network delays, and mining success.

This approach has proven effective at identifying issues such as:
- Transaction nonce validation bugs
- Race conditions in block processing
- Chain synchronization edge cases
- Peer discovery and connection management issues

The framework serves both as a testing tool and a demonstration of the network's resilience under continuous operation.
