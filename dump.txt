# GoCuria - Go Blockchain Implementation

## Project Overview
GoCuria is a complete blockchain implementation written in Go, featuring a full P2P networking layer, consensus mechanism, transaction processing, and block validation system. It's designed as a learning and development platform for understanding blockchain fundamentals and distributed systems.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Blockchain Engine** (`blockchain/`)
   - Block creation, validation, and mining
   - Transaction processing with digital signatures (Ed25519)
   - Proof-of-Work consensus with dynamic difficulty adjustment
   - UTXO-style transaction model with account balances
   - Genesis block initialization

2. **P2P Network Layer** (`p2p/`)
   - TCP-based peer-to-peer communication
   - Request-response pattern for block/peer requests
   - Broadcast mechanisms for blocks and transactions
   - Peer discovery and management
   - Connection handling with handshake protocol
   - Message routing and protocol handling

3. **Storage System** (`blockchain/store/`)
   - In-memory blockchain storage
   - Chain state management
   - Block retrieval by hash
   - Account balance tracking

4. **Node Implementation** (`node/`)
   - Full node orchestration
   - Service coordination (P2P, discovery, blockchain)
   - Transaction submission API

## Go Language Features Utilized

### Concurrency & Networking
- **Goroutines**: Extensive use for concurrent block processing, P2P message handling, peer discovery
- **Channels**: Service functions return completion channels (`<-chan struct{}`) for async operation tracking
- **Mutexes**: Thread-safe access to shared state (peer connections, orphan pools, recent blocks)
- **TCP Networking**: Raw TCP connections for P2P communication
- **JSON Encoding**: Message serialization between peers

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated into service functions
- **Interface-based Design**: Clean abstractions for storage and processing
- **Dependency Injection**: Configuration-driven component assembly
- **Function-first Approach**: Stateless service functions over OOP methods

### Error Handling & Validation
- **Custom Error Types**: Specific error types for missing parents, validation failures
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Block validation, transaction verification, signature checking
- **Graceful Degradation**: Orphan block handling, peer disconnection recovery

## Blockchain Features

### Consensus & Mining
- **Proof-of-Work**: SHA-256 based mining with configurable difficulty
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Automatic adjustment based on block intervals
- **Block Structure**: Headers with previous hash, merkle root, timestamp, nonce
- **Target Block Time**: Configurable block generation intervals

### Transaction System
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 cryptographic signatures
- **Account Model**: From/To address transactions with nonce protection
- **Coinbase Transactions**: Miner rewards and new coin generation
- **Transaction Validation**: Balance checks, signature verification, replay protection

### Network Protocol
- **Block Propagation**: Efficient block relay with deduplication
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatic peer finding and connection management
- **Request/Response**: Synchronous block and peer requests
- **Orphan Handling**: Automatic parent block requests for orphaned blocks

## P2P Network Design

### Message Types
- **Handshake**: Node identification and chain height exchange
- **NewBlock**: Block announcements and propagation
- **NewTx**: Transaction broadcasting
- **RequestBlock/RequestPeers**: Synchronous data requests
- **SharePeers**: Peer list sharing for discovery

### Network Topology
- **Mesh Network**: Nodes connect to multiple peers
- **Gossip Protocol**: Block and transaction propagation
- **Seed Node Bootstrap**: Initial peer discovery
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and cleanup

### Anti-Spam & Performance
- **Recent Blocks Cache**: Prevents duplicate block processing
- **Orphan Pool**: Temporary storage for blocks with missing parents
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable peer limits
- **Broadcast Storm Prevention**: Deduplication mechanisms

## Service Architecture Patterns

### Clean Separation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Connection management, message handling
- **Protocol Layer**: Message routing and parsing
- **Business Logic Layer**: Block processing, validation, relay logic
- **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean import hierarchy

### Async Operations
- **Completion Channels**: All service operations return tracking channels
- **Non-blocking**: Fire-and-forget operations for broadcasts
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup and connection termination

## Testing & Quality

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Block Propagation Tests**: Multi-node network propagation verification
- **Deduplication Tests**: Duplicate block/message handling
- **Connection Tests**: Peer discovery and connection establishment
- **Synchronization Tests**: Block request/response functionality

### Real Network Simulation
- **Multi-node Testing**: Tests with 3-4 interconnected nodes
- **Network Topologies**: Linear chains, star patterns, mesh networks
- **Connection Scenarios**: Bootstrap, discovery, reconnection

## Development Highlights

### Recent Refactoring
- **Eliminated BlockProcessor**: Moved block processing to P2P service layer
- **Removed Circular Dependencies**: Clean architecture with proper separation
- **Service Function Pattern**: Function-based business logic over methods
- **Completion Channel Pattern**: Async tracking for all operations

### Code Quality
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library focused
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined abstractions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error propagation and handling
